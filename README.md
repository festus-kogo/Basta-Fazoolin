### Basta Fazoolin'

You’ve started a position as the lead programmer for the family-style Italian restaurant Basta Fazoolin’ with My Heart. The restaurant has been doing fantastically and seen a lot of growth lately. You’ve been hired to keep things organized.

### Making the Menus

**1.** At *Basta Fazoolin’ with my Heart* our motto is simple: when you’re here with family, that’s great! We have four different menus: brunch, early-bird, dinner, and kids.

Create a `Menu` class .

**2.** Give `Menu` a constructor with the five parameters `self`, `name`, `items`, `start_time`, and `end_time`.

3. Let’s create our first menu: `brunch`. Brunch is served from 11am to 4pm. The following items are sold during brunch:

```
{
  'pancakes': 7.50, 'waffles': 9.00, 'burger': 11.00, 'home fries': 4.50, 'coffee': 1.50, 'espresso': 3.00, 'tea': 1.00, 'mimosa': 10.50, 'orange juice': 3.50
}
```

**4.** Let’s create our second menu item `early_bird`. Early-bird Dinners are served from 3pm to 6pm. The following items are available during the early-bird menu:

}
```

}
```

**6.** And let’s create our last menu, `kids`. The kids menu is available from 11am until 9pm. The following items are available on the kids menu.
